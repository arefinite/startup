    "description": "Digital Natives (20-40 years) have a strong interest in art and culture but no time to gain an overview. So, they either don’t visit museums or always visit the same ones even though they long for variety. At the same time, museums suffer from dropping ticket revenues and inexistent customer relationships, especially with 20-40 year olds.\n\n\n\nWith myCulture, we're developing an app that provides users with personalised recommendations for art exhibitions – based on their interests. Like Netflix for art. That way, they receive a quick overview over relevant exhibitions and can directly book their museum ticket. With Digital Natives, museums reach a new target group and they can re-engage with them after their visit.\n\n\n\nWe’ve built a community of +2000 art lover of which over 130 have already signed up for our app pre-launch. We’re currently in talks with 40 museums in Vienna out of which 10 have already signed a contract with us. \n\n\n\nFor each ticket sold, museums pay a transaction fee of 15 %. App users receive incentives that are connected to a point system.\n\nThis is part of our referral strategy which, in combination with social media, PR and partnerships, will generate 6,000 bookings in the first year.\n\n\n\nmyCulture combines the best of event calendars, booking platforms and personalised travel guides.\n\nAnd there is more to come. New features, new markets and we're not limiting ourselves to visual arts but also want to expand into other cultural segments like theatre, opera and cabaret.\n\n\n\nmyCulture was founded and is managed by Vera L. B. Grablechner, a serial entrepreneur, business consultant and marketing expert with a passion for arts & culture. She's supported by a team of tech and creative talents as well as a strong advisory board with Sergiu Ardelean (Founder & CEO at Artivive) and Reanne Leuning (Director Creative Industries at Advantage Asutria).\n\n\n\nApp development and marketing costs for the app launch are covered by public funding and own funds. To scale our business, we are seeking an investment of 300,000 euros.",

Appstract Shared Shopping enables stores to provide their customers the ability to invite friends and family into the store, where they will be able to go shopping together, and discuss and compare the products they are shopping. You can initially think of it as Google Docs for shopping, but it is so much more. Our platform enables agencies and ecommerce companies to extend on our basic shared shopping experience and easily build completely custom shared shopping experiences.",

The month-long Kickoff is for companies that are unsure of their needs, their scale, or whether an external CTO is the right solution for their needs. Kickoff is a month-long and similar in content to the Maintenance package, but can be taken as a one-off start to a new customer base. Maintenance is the maintenance product on which every customer base is built. The Maintenance package is the basis for an active customer base that includes enough working time to complete the company's day-to-day operations and smaller projects. Active is an extension to the Maintenance service, which allows time for, for example, the mapping, implementation and aftercare of a new project. Active packages can also be used to start an enhanced Maintenance service if a company has an urgent need to create a technical roadmap or other more intensive work.",

As usual, Jere believed he had some excellent company name suggestions. They were all labelled as vegan. It's a very harsh word, so some people weren't as convinced. Such a weight falls on the V-word. In frustration, Jere said on Whatsapp, \"Vegan is just a five letter term.\" Then we got it right. These foods are vegan, yes, but you cannot mention that. They are hence five-letter foods.",

Unfortunately, the commonly used unstructured interview style is notoriously prone to bias and a poor predictor of job performance.

Our founder, Joachim “NoobworK” Haraldsen is Norway’s most profiled gamer with an impressive industry network and a vision to position Heroic and the Nordic region at the top of the global esports scene. Omaken Sports recently raised NOK 150 million in capital, enabling the acquisition of Heroic and several other growth initiatives currently in the making. Heroic now has the second best professional CS:GO team globally, a world-leading PUBG roster, and a very promising simracing set-up. With rapid growth as our main objective, we are quickly entering new games, signing new elite teams, positioning for franchise stakes in top leagues, and attracting world-class commercial partners. The timing is now, and the opportunities are many. Initially, our main target is to conquer the elite esports segment under the Heroic banner.

It’s how we do it, that really makes the difference. Well, to start with the obvious one: You won’t find any ONNA-farmers with dirt on their hands. Because we don’t grow our crops in soil, but in a mineral solution. Actually, it’s not really on the ground either. Our salads and herbs are stacked vertically to allow for a smaller area footprint and efficient resource use in our controlled cultivation environments. This makes us able to grow closer to cities, minimize transport from harvest to table – and increase local self-sufficiency.",

The state-of-the-art is to develop proprietary solutions that have to be altered each time one of the sensors of the navigation system is modified. Our high-precision navigation and sensor fusion platform is independent of the sensors chosen to equip our customers for fast development of new autonomous solutions.

Noytrall is an evidence-based tech that integrates to the property PMS and enables either hotels and guests to reduce these valuable resources consumption. The equation is simple: the more conscious a guest's resource consumption behavior is; the more the guest qualifies to pay less; the better the hotel's operation efficiency is; the less the hotel's footprint is. It is a helpful hand for hoteliers either to reposition their properties in response to the trending and growing demand looking for sustainable-based travel experiences. And to adjust their operations in response to the pressing social, corporate, and political stands related to their business's footprint mitigation towards carbon neutrality. Deploying noytrall is to be in the right way to accomplish any ESG goals consistently. With noytrall, guests are finally called to take action in hospitality's sustainability equation.",

Maven's mission is to change pet care as a whole, by taking a preventive approach.\n\n\n\nOur hardware continuously tracks each pet, gathering detailed information regarding their location and activity over time. This data is cross-referenced with their individual profile by Maven’s AI. Relevant behavior changes are brought to our Vet team's attention for further examination, allowing accurate diagnosis.\n\n\n\nIf you’re motivated to revolutionise pet’s wellbeing and safety worldwide and you enjoy collaborating with charismatic team members, solving complex challenges and having a real impact on customer’s lives, keep on reading, this is the company for you.",

Noytrall is an evidence-based tech that integrates to the property PMS and enables either hotels and guests to reduce these valuable resources consumption. The equation is simple: the more conscious a guest's resource consumption behavior is; the more the guest qualifies to pay less; the better the hotel's operation efficiency is; the less the hotel's footprint is. It is a helpful hand for hoteliers either to reposition their properties in response to the trending and growing demand looking for sustainable-based travel experiences. And to adjust their operations in response to the pressing social, corporate, and political stands related to their business's footprint mitigation towards carbon neutrality. Deploying noytrall is to be in the right way to accomplish any ESG goals consistently. With noytrall, guests are finally called to take action in hospitality's sustainability equation.",

The difference between KatWalk glasses and VR glasses is given by the fact that you have unlimited space for movement, while virtual reality imposes a 5m limit on you, and the experience is much more intense. We thought of creating this space out of a passion for gaming, for everything related to modern technology and virtual reality, but especially for social experience. We know how much your friends mean to you, so we provide multiplayer games and VR racing simulators. Univrse is the intersection between the pleasure of playing (individually or in a group), escaping from reality itself and entering an imagined world. It is the place where you can learn things from various fields, in an interactive and captivating way! It is the place where you can face your anxiety and treat certain phobias, such as fear of flying, closed spaces, etc. Univrse can also be your host for the coolest special events of your life, be it a birthday or a corporate.

VoxiKids transform speech therapy processes by moving them into the digital market. We’re bringing a SaaS platform to the e-health market, offering a selection of high-value materials designed by speech pathologists, as well as management tools that streamline the collaboration between parent and therapist, with the common goal of assisting the child's recovery and integrating them into the pre-school and school environments.\n\nMission: VoxiKids digitalizes the speech therapy process in order to positively impact children with speech impairments and reduce recovery time, thus helping them better integrate into their social environment and school community. We can achieve this by bringing both parents and therapists together for the benefit of the child’s development.\n\n\n\nThe problem: The e-health market is now in full expansion, with opportunities arising at a global level. Traditional speech therapy requires a dedicated space, work materials, and a qualified speech pathologist. But in a world caught in the fray of digitalization, where recent events have put even more pressure on us to digitalize as many processes as possible, we’ve also noticed a change in the way that speech therapy sessions can be carried out. Across the world, 34 million children are in need of access to speech therapy, and over half a million of them are in Romania.\n\n\n\nThe real problem is that speech therapy practices are few and far between. There are countries where a parent must wait up to 24 months to gain access to therapy.",

Headquartered in Lausanne’s Biopôle, Switzerland, Hedera Dx was created in 2021 with the mission to give access to liquid biopsy technologies to patients at risk of or already suffering from cancer. Co-founded by Tommi Lehtonen, Damien Lapray and Christian Meisel, Hedera Dx is an ambitious, fast growing and passionate scale-up employing 15+ people across Switzerland and Europe. \n\n\n\nLiquid biopsy tests are powerful blood-based technologies for cancer diagnosis and they are starting to enter the clinic. The information gathered from these analyses will take our awareness of cancer to the next level unlocking new possibilities of diagnosis and care. However, all of these new technologies add a lot of complexities to the daily clinical workflow requiring new tools for easy access and usability. \n\n\n\nThe Hedera Dx platform, Hedera Prime, solves that challenge, giving a streamlined experience for clinicians to use liquid biopsy tests in early detection, therapy selection and recurrence monitoring.",

An essential tool for global expats, digital nomads, permanent residents, dual residents, overseas homeowners, and frequent travellers.\n\n\n\nAUTO TRIP RECORDING\n\nWith geolocation tracking, Flamingo automatically determines if you have left your residence country or state and accurately records your trip details so that you don’t have to. Keep tabs on the countries and states you’ve visited and how many days you spent there.\n\n\n\nSCHENGEN AREA CALCULATOR\n\nIf you frequently travel to the EU Schengen Travel Area as a non-resident, it can be a hassle to keep up with the 90 in 180 days rule. Flamingo counts how many combined days you’ve already spent in Schengen countries and how many more you have left in the 180-day period. If you’re already located in the EU as a non-resident, Flamingo tells you the date when you have to leave to avoid overstaying.\n\nThe built-in calculator helps you determine not only the earliest date you can travel to the EU for your desired number of days, but also for how many days you can stay if you arrive on your desired date.\n\n\n\nVISA-FREE STAY\n\nBased on your citizenship, Flamingo automatically identifies to which countries you need a visa, e-visa, or visa on arrival and where you can travel absolutely visa-free.\n\nComing soon: Flamingo will also tell you how long you can stay in each country visa-free, monitor your duration of stay and alert you when you’ll be close to overstaying.\n\n\n\nRESIDENCE STATUS FOR COUNTRIES & US STATES\n\nFlamingo helps you determine your physical presence for domicile and residency by automatically recording and counting how many days you spend there.\n\n*Especially useful for Statutory Residence Test for UK expats and Substantial and Physical Presence Tests for US expats and permanent residents.\n\n\n\nEXPORT REPORTS\n\nYou can download a customizable CSV report with your travel details with the tap of a button. Share it with authorities and lawyers in seconds or keep it for your own travel records.\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE PRIVACY\n\nYour travel, residency, and visa data is stored locally only on your device.
